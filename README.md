# HeteroGenesis
## Introduction
HeteroGenesis is used to generate genomes for multiple related clones in a heterogeneous tumour, along with a matched germline genome. For each clone and germline sample, it provides FASTA files containing the sequences for each copy of a chromosome in the genome, and files detailing the variants incorporated. 

A separate tool, FreqCalc, can be used to combine the variant call format (VCF) and copy number files generated by HeteroGenesis to give overall bulk tumour outputs that reflect user defined proportions of each clone in a tumour, and its purity. This is useful, for example, when the user intends to carry out *in silico* sequencing of each clone and combine the reads to form a bulk tumour dataset.

## Requirements
Python3 is required to run both HeteroGenesis and FreqCalc. numpy is also required for running HeteroGenesis. 
Both tools have been tested with Python 3.5.2 and numpy 1.12.0 and 1.12.1.
## Installation

In the heterogenesis directory, type:
```
python setup.py install
```
 
## Overview

HeteroGenesis is implemented in two parts: 

The first, **heterogenesis\_vargen**, takes: i) a FASTA genome sequence, ii) a .fai index file for the genome sequence, iii) an optional file containing known germline SNV and InDel locations and minor allele frequencies from dbSNP, and iv) a JSON file containing a set of parameters. It outputs a JSON file with lists of variants for the germline and each clone in the simulated tumour, as well as files containing the order that mutations occurred in each. 

The second part, **heterogenesis\_varincorp** is then run, once for each clone, and incorporates the list of variants for a clone into a reference genome. It outputs: i) the FASTA genome sequence (one file for each copy of a chromosome), ii) a VCF file of SNV and InDel positions and frequencies, and iii) a file containing the copy numbers along the genome.

**FreqCalc** can then be run to cobine outputs from clones to generate bulk tumour outputs. It takes a file containing the proportions of each clone in a tumour, along with the outputs from heterogenesis\_varincorp, and outputs equivalent files for the bulk tumour.


##Inputs
###heterogenesis_vargen
1. **Reference Genome:**
The starting genome sequence, in FASTA format, that variants will be incorporated into. 
2. **Reference Genome Index:**
A .fai index file for the reference genome, created with samtools faidx. This should be saved in the same directory as the reference genome.
3. **dbSNP File:**
...

4. **Parameters File:**
A JSON file containing run parameters and locations of other inputs. Any parameter that is missing from the file will be set at its default value:
 
	(An example parameters file is provided in the repository - 'example.json')

|Parameter|Description|Default Value| 
|---|---|---|
|prefix	|String added to output file names.|""|
|reference|FASTA file containing the sequence of a reference or other input genome. Must have a .fai index file located in the same directory. |Required|
|dbsnp|VCF file from dbSNP containing known germline SNPs and InDels.|none|
|directory|Directory to output all files to.|"./"|
|structure|Structure of clones in the tumour, in the format: “clone1\_name, clone1\_distance\_from\_parent, clone1\_parent\_name, clone2_name, clone2\_distance\_from\_parent, clone2\_parent\_name…”. All parent clone names must also be listed as a separate clone, ie. if clone2’s parent clone is clone1, then clone1 must also be listed as a clone with a parent clone. The exception to this is when the parent clone is ‘germline’, and this must occur at least once as the parent clone for the root clone of the tumour. Loops in the lineage will cause the program to never end, ie. clone1->clone2->clone3->clone1. Distances from parent clones can be any fraction or number as they are used relative to each other.|"clone1,0.2,germline,clone2,0.8,clone1"|
|snvgermline|Rate of germline SNVs per base.|0.00014|
|indgermline|Rate of germline indels per base|0.000014|
|cnvrepgermline|Number of germline replication CNVs.|160|
|cnvdelgermline|Number of germline deletion CNVs.|1000|
|aneuploid|Number of somatic aneuploid events. i.e. replication or deletion of a chromosome. Copy number is randomly chosen from 0, 2 or 3. Germline aneuploid events are not available.|2|
|snvsomatic|Rate of somatic SNVs per base.|0.00001|
|indsomatic|Rate of somatic indels per base.|0.000001|
|cnvrepsomatic|Number of somatic replication CNVs.|250|
|cnvdelsomatic|Number of somatic deletion CNVs.|250|
|dbsnpsnvproportion|Proportion of germline SNVs taken from dbSNP. The default value is taken from an estimate of the proportion of SNVs found in dbSNP for coding regions, to make the genomes suitable for use with whole-exome *in silico* sequencing. The user may therefore wish to adjust this if they intend to use the genomes for other purposes. |0.9|
|dbsnpindelproportion|Proportion of germline InDels taken from dbSNP. Default value taken from estimates for coding regions, as above. |0.5|
|chromosomes|List of chromosomes to include in the model. Alternatively, "all" can be given, in which case chromosomes 1-22 will be used. This only works for genomes for which chromosomes are labelled 'chr1','chr2'... (Also note that X and Y are not included with "all")|”all”|

CNV lengths and copy numbers, and indel lengths are taken from lognormal distributions, that are defined by the mean and variance of the underlying normal distribution. Values from these distributions are then scaled up by a multiplication factor for cnv lengths. Indel length distributions are the same for germline and somatic.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
|cnvgermlinemean|Germline CNV length lognormal mean.|-10|
|cnvgermlinevariance|Germline CNV length lognormal variance|3|
|cnvgermlinemultiply|Germline CNV length multiplication factor.|1000000|
|cnvsomaticmean	|Somatic CNV length lognormal mean.|-1|
|cnvsomaticvariance|Somatic CNV length lognormal variance.|3|
|cnvsomaticmultiply|Somatic CNV length multiplication factor.|1000000|
|indmean|Indel length lognormal mean.|-2|
|indvariance|Indel length lognormal variance.|2|
|indmultiply|Indel length multiplication factor.|1|
|cnvcopiesmean|CNV copies lognormal mean.|1|
|cnvcopiesvariance|CNV copies lognormal variance.|0.5|


###heterogenesis_varincorp

1. **Parameters File:**
The same JSON file as used for heterogenesis\_vargen can be given but only the following parameters are used. These should contain the same values as given for heterogenesis\_vargen: 

|Parameter|Description|Default Value|

|prefix	|String added to output file names.|""|
|reference|FASTA file containing the sequence of a reference or other input genome. Must have a .fai index file located in the same directory. |Required|
|directory|Directory containing JSON output from heterogenesis\_vargen and where output files will be written to.|"./"|
|chromosomes|List of chromosomes included in the model. Alternatively, "all" can be given, in which case chromosomes 1-22 will be used. This only works for genomes for which chromosomes are labelled 'chr1','chr2'... (Also note that X and Y are not included with "all")|”all”|

File with clone proportions in format: 'clone name' \t 'fraction’.
